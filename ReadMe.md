# poker-engine readme
This Java based poker engine was initially developed to play No Limit Texas Hold'em.
As such it is not a full featured poker playing application, but it could be
used in the construction of such a program. The console based player was
included in the library only as a means for testing and was not intended to
be used by anyone to actually play poker.

## The Rules

**Number of Players Supported:** 2-10






## Notes
- In real life there is not an actual cap on the number of players except for the 
limits imposed by the size of table used, and the number of cards in the deck. I needed
to draw the line somewhere, and 10 seemed like a good number.
